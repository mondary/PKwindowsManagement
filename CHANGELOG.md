# Changelog

## [0.18] - 2026-06-16
### Added
- Menu bar now displays the app's official icon (full color) instead of a generic SF Symbol
- Settings sidebar header shows the official app icon alongside the app name
- Archive snippet available by default for every install, with a dedicated icon and a `Right Command + S` shortcut
- Archive keeps both files on name conflicts (Finder-style `file 2.ext`, `file 3.ext`)
- Archive moves Desktop items to a fast local archive first, then mirrors them to Google Drive in the background (throttled, non-blocking) — no more Mac freeze on large folders
### Changed
- Archive no longer overwrites or prompts on duplicate names
- Archive monthly folders now use deterministic French names (`2026_06_juin`) instead of relying on the process locale
- `DesktopArchive` now points to the Google Drive archive when detected, while keeping the fast local archive as the initial write target
### Fixed
- Duplicate Archive snippets (manual + default) collapsed into a single canonical entry, preserving the existing shortcut
